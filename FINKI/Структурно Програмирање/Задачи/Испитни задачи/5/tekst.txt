Sheets of Empty canvas, Untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before Me as her body once did.
All five horizons revolved arounD Her soul as tHe Earth to the sun
Now the air I Tasted and bReathed has taKen a turn
Ooh, And all I Taught her was everytHing
Ooh, I knoW shE gave Me all that sHe wore
